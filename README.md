# DeepFakes-Detection

## My Approach -

- We take 15 uniformly time-spaced frames from the video and work upon them.
- Then we crop out the area around the person's face in each frame using the Harrcascade module.
- Harrcascade performs pixel-wise face localisation on various scales of faces by taking advantages of joint extra-supervised and self-supervised multi-task learning. 
- We use Harrcascade with Resnet-50 as the encoder model.
- After getting the cropped face we normalizing it and resize every pictures to (320,320,3) shape, i.e. an rgb image of 320px * 320px
- We finally use an ensemble of Efficient-Net and Xception net by getting there predictions as probabilites and then try out different ratios for the both of them.
- The best ratio was with giving 30% weightage to the xception model's score and 70% to the efficient net model.

## Results
- This model acheived 2nd place in the [DeepFake Detection Challenge hosted on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/deepfake-detection/overview)
- F1 Score on the testing dataset = 0.861

# Deepfake Videos Detection üîçüé•

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent synthetic media, commonly referred to as **Deepfakes**, where a person‚Äôs likeness in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else‚Äôs. These Deepfakes are often created using **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and have the potential to be exploited for criminal activities, making detection crucial in today‚Äôs world of AI-generated media.

## Key Features
- **Computer Vision & Video Processing**: Leveraging OpenCV and advanced neural networks for real-time Deepfake detection.
- **Face Detection**: Employed **OpenCV‚Äôs Haarcascade classifiers** for precise face recognition, which enhanced the system‚Äôs accuracy and speed in locating facial features.
- **Deep Learning Model Ensemble**: Combined the strengths of **ResNet50** and **Xception Net** models, both pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, to achieve high performance.
- **Performance Metrics**: Achieved an impressive **F1 Score of 0.861**, highlighting the robustness of the model against challenging deepfake datasets.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenCV**: Used for efficient face detection and video processing.
- **PyTorch**: For building, training, and fine-tuning neural networks.
- **TensorFlow**: To help integrate deep learning models into video workflows.
- **CNN Models**: Ensembled **ResNet50** and **Xception Net**, both pre-trained, to handle subtle facial variations in deepfake videos.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/deepfake-detection.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the pre-trained models:
   - [ResNet50 Weights](https://download.pytorch.org/models/resnet50-19c8e357.pth)
   - [Xception Weights](https://path/to/xception)

4. Run the detection pipeline:
   ```bash
   python detect_deepfakes.py --input /path/to/video
   ```

## How It Works üí°
1. **Face Detection**: The system identifies faces in video frames using **OpenCV‚Äôs Haarcascade**.
2. **Frame Processing**: Each detected face is passed through a pipeline where an ensemble of **ResNet50** and **Xception Net** models determine if the frame is a Deepfake.
3. **Prediction Aggregation**: Frame-level predictions are aggregated across the entire video, giving a final verdict on whether the input video is a Deepfake or not.

## Results üìä
- **Precision**: 0.88
- **Recall**: 0.85
- **F1 Score**: 0.861

The combination of computer vision techniques and cutting-edge deep learning models makes this system highly efficient in identifying Deepfakes in videos.
